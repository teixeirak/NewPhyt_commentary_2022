As the climate changes and scientists seek to project its future course, an important uncertainty lies in the response of forests. 
Will rising atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO~2~) and lengthening growing seasons relieve limitations to tree growth, allowing increased carbon (C) sequestration in long-lived woody tissues and providing a negative feedback to climate change?
Or will increasing heat and drought stress reduce growth and increase mortality, resulting in a positive feedback to climate change?
To answer this question, global C cycle models simulate photosynthesis under future conditions, using simple plant C allocation schemes to determine the amount of C sequestered in woody growth versus that allocated to short-lived pools and rapidly respired back to the atmosphere as CO~2~ [@fatichi_moving_2014]. 
Yet, there is growing evidence that these schemes are too simplistic, as wood production is in fact decoupled from photosynthesis, being itself directly influenced by climatic drivers [@delpierre_wood_2016; @etzold_number_2022].
Needed, then, is an understanding of how woody growth is jointly shaped by photosynthesis and climate variables under a range of conditions.
In this issue of *New Phytologist*, Martinez-Sancho *et al.* (pp. 000-000) exemplifies the type of research needed to improve our ability to predict forest C sequestration under climate change, using an innovative approach to describe the seasonal course of carbon sequestration in tree stem growth and how this is affected by drought.

*(summarize/ explain Martinez-Sancho method)*
(Builds on methods pioneered by @cuny_generalized_2013, @perez-de-lis_cutting_2022, @cuny_woody_2015.)

*(describe typical seasonal patterns, including what was known and what Martinez-Sancho contributed.)*
 
*(talk about drought impacts)*
@martinez-sancho_drought_2022 showed that C sequestration was reduced 67% during a 41-day period of extreme summer drought in 2015, during which time rates of cell enlargement and thickening were slowed. 
Meanwhile, ∂^13^C isotopes indicated increased C isotope discrimination, indicative of water limitation resulting in higher intrinsic water use efficiency during the drought. 
However, the total number of cells formed was unchanged, and higher compensatory growth and C sequestration rates after the drought resulted in similar total C sequestration during the drought and reference years [@martinez-sancho_drought_2022].
Thus, study of intraannual dynamics of wood formation revealed dynamics that would have gone undetected at the annual scale.

The findings of @martinez-sancho_drought_2022 point to the importance of the timing of drought.
*(some content on how drought timing affects annual growth -- e.g., @dorangeville_drought_2018)*

 
The @martinez-sancho_drought_2022 study adds to growing evidence that CO~2~ uptake and woody production are decoupled. 
...[@jiang_fate_2020]
...[@dow_warm_inpress]
...[@cabon_crossbiome_2022] 
…. [@kannenberg_droughtinduced_2022]
Of course, these observations of decoupling do not imply that *ANPP~woody~* is completely decoupled from *GPP*; rather, the two show some level of correlation both in relation to interannual climatic variation at a single site [@cabon_crossbiome_2022] and across broad climatic gradients [@banburymorgan_global_2021]. 
However, we now have clear evidence that it is not realistic to expect that a constant allocation of photosynthate will be allocated to woody growth on either intraanuual or interannual time scales.

*(one paragraph discussing models)*
C allocation to woody growth is an important parameter in models, yet models get it wrong.
Therefore, this is an important uncertainty.  
To get models right, we need to understand seasonal patterns of C allocation to woody growth and how they are influenced by climate variation (and change)

We need more studies like @martinez-sancho_drought_2022 -- bonus if they also get GPP -- to broaden our understanding of how *ANPP~woody~* is jointly shaped by climate-- both directly and indirectly (through GPP).
