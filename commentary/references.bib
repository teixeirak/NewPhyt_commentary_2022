  abstract = {Carbon (C) fixation, allocation, and metabolism by trees set the basis for energy and material flows in forest ecosystems and define their interactions with Earth's changing climate. However, while many studies have considered variation in productivity with latitude and climate, we lack a cohesive synthesis on how forest carbon fluxes vary globally with respect to climate and one another. Here, we draw upon 1,319 records from the Global Forest Carbon Database, representing all major forest types and the nine most significant autotrophic carbon fluxes, to comprehensively review how annual C cycling in mature, undisturbed forests varies with latitude and climate on a global scale. Across all flux variables analyzed, rates of C cycling decreased continuously with absolute latitude\textemdash a finding that confirms multiple previous studies and contradicts the idea that net primary productivity of temperate forests rivals that of tropical forests. C flux variables generally displayed similar trends across latitude and multiple climate variables, with no differences in allocation detected at this global scale. Temperature variables in general, and mean annual temperature or temperature seasonality in particular, were the best single predictors of C flux, explaining 19\%\textendash 71\% of variation in the C fluxes analyzed. The effects of temperature were modified by moisture availability, with C flux reduced under hot and dry conditions and sometimes under very high precipitation. Annual C fluxes increased with growing season length and were also influenced by growing season climate. These findings clarify how forest C flux varies with latitude and climate on a global scale. In an era when forests will play a critical yet uncertain role in shaping Earth's rapidly changing climate, our synthesis provides a foundation for understanding global patterns in forest C cycling.},

  abstract = {The intra-annual dynamics of wood formation, which involves the passage of newly produced cells through three successive differentiation phases (division, enlargement, and wall thickening) to reach the final functional mature state, has traditionally been described in conifers as three delayed bell-shaped curves followed by an S-shaped curve. Here the classical view represented by the `Gompertz function (GF) approach' was challenged using two novel approaches based on parametric generalized linear models (GLMs) and `data-driven' generalized additive models (GAMs). These three approaches (GFs, GLMs, and GAMs) were used to describe seasonal changes in cell numbers in each of the xylem differentiation phases and to calculate the timing of cell development in three conifer species [Picea abies (L.), Pinus sylvestris L., and Abies alba Mill.]. GAMs outperformed GFs and GLMs in describing intra-annual wood formation dynamics, showing two left-skewed bell-shaped curves for division and enlargement, and a right-skewed bimodal curve for thickening. Cell residence times progressively decreased through the season for enlargement, whilst increasing late but rapidly for thickening. These patterns match changes in cell anatomical features within a tree ring, which allows the separation of earlywood and latewood into two distinct cell populations. A novel statistical approach is presented which renews our understanding of xylogenesis, a dynamic biological process in which the rate of cell production interplays with cell residence times in each developmental phase to create complex seasonal patterns.},

Here, we aimed to identify which drivers control the interannual variability of wood growth in a mesic temperate deciduous forest. We analysed a 9-yr time series of carbon fluxes and aboveground wood growth (AWG), reconstructed at a weekly time-scale through the combination of dendrometer and wood density data. Carbon inputs and AWG anomalies appeared to be uncorrelated from the seasonal to interannual scales. More than 90\% of the interannual variability of AWG was explained by a combination of the growth intensity during a first `critical period' of the wood growing season, occurring close to the seasonal maximum, and the timing of the first summer growth halt. Both atmospheric and soil water stress exerted a strong control on the interannual variability of AWG at the study site, despite its mesic conditions, whilst not affecting carbon inputs. Carbon sink activity, not carbon inputs, determined the interannual variations in wood growth at the study site. Our results provide a functional understanding of the dependence of radial growth on precipitation observed in dendrological studies.},

  abstract = {Projected changes in temperature and drought regime are likely to reduce carbon (C) storage in forests, thereby amplifying rates of climate change. While such reductions are often presumed to be greatest in semi-arid forests that experience widespread tree mortality, the consequences of drought may also be important in temperate mesic forests of Eastern North America (ENA) if tree growth is significantly curtailed by drought. Investigations of the environmental conditions that determine drought sensitivity are critically needed to accurately predict ecosystem feedbacks to climate change. We matched site factors with the growth responses to drought of 10,753 trees across mesic forests of ENA, representing 24 species and 346 stands, to determine the broad-scale drivers of drought sensitivity for the dominant trees in ENA. Here we show that two factors\textemdash the timing of drought, and the atmospheric demand for water (i.e., local potential evapotranspiration; PET)\textemdash are stronger drivers of drought sensitivity than soil and stand characteristics. Drought-induced reductions in tree growth were greatest when the droughts occurred during early-season peaks in radial growth, especially for trees growing in the warmest, driest regions (i.e., highest PET). Further, mean species trait values (rooting depth and {$\psi$}50) were poor predictors of drought sensitivity, as intraspecific variation in sensitivity was equal to or greater than interspecific variation in 17 of 24 species. From a general circulation model ensemble, we find that future increases in early-season PET may exacerbate these effects, and potentially offset gains in C uptake and storage in ENA owing to other global change factors.},

The latter finding was confirmed on the centennial scale by 207 tree-ring chronologies from 108 forests across eastern North America, where annual growth was far more sensitive to temperatures during the peak growing season than in the spring. These findings imply that extra CO2 uptake in years with warmer springs10\textendash 12 is not allocated to long-lived woody biomass, where it could have a substantial and lasting impact on the forest C balance.  Rather, contradicting current projections from global C cycle models2,3,17,18, our empirical results imply that warming spring temperatures are unlikely to increase the woody productivity or strengthen the CO2 sink of temperate deciduous forests.},

Growth of all species peaked in the early part of the growth season and commenced shortly before the summer solstice, but with species-specific seasonal patterns. Day length set a window of opportunity for radial growth. Within this window, the probability of daily growth was constrained particularly by air and soil moisture, resulting in intermittent growth to occur only on 29 to 77 days (30\% to 80\%) within the growth period. The number of days with growth largely determined annual growth, whereas the growth period length contributed less.

Therefore predictions by current photosynthesis-driven models of large increases in future vegetation biomass due to increasing concentrations of atmospheric CO 2 may be significant over-estimations. We describe how current understanding of wood formation can be used to reformulate global vegetation models, with potentially major implications for their behaviour.},

Although evidence gathered from young aggrading forests has generally indicated a strong CO2 fertilization effect on biomass growth3\textendash 5, it is unclear whether mature forests respond to eCO2 in a similar way. In mature trees and forest stands7\textendash 10, photosynthetic uptake has been found to increase under eCO2 without any apparent accompanying growth response, leaving the fate of additional carbon fixed under eCO2 unclear4,5,7\textendash 11. Here using data from the first ecosystem-scale Free-Air CO2 Enrichment (FACE) experiment in a mature forest, we constructed a comprehensive ecosystem carbon budget to track the fate of carbon as the forest responded to four years of eCO2 exposure. We show that, although the eCO2 treatment of +150 parts per million (+38 per cent) above ambient levels induced a 12 per cent (+247 grams of carbon per square metre per year) increase in carbon uptake through gross primary production, this additional carbon uptake did not lead to increased carbon sequestration at the ecosystem level. Instead, the majority of the extra carbon was emitted back into the atmosphere via several respiratory fluxes, with increased soil respiration alone accounting for half of the total uptake surplus. Our results call into question the predominant thinking that the capacity of forests to act as carbon sinks will be generally enhanced under eCO2, and challenge the efficacy of climate mitigation strategies that rely on ubiquitous CO2 fertilization as a driver of increased carbon sinks in global forests.},

To analyze the role of climatic drivers and local site differences on tree growth at sub-annual timescales, we studied the timing, magnitude and climatic drivers of stem growth and xylem formation at two tropical forest sites with contrasting soil water availability in southwestern China. We combined high-resolution point dendrometer recordings and microcoring to investigate intra-annual stem radius variation and xylem formation of Toona ciliata over three consecutive years (2018\textendash 2020). Stem radial increment of T. ciliata derived from dendrometer data showed distinct seasonal patterns, with growth mainly occurring during March to October. The start day of stem radial growth coincided with the occurrence of the cell enlarging phase, and its end day occurred concomitantly with the cessation of cell enlarging as identified from microcores. Toona ciliata trees at the tropical ravine rainforest site with higher soil water availability showed higher mean annual stem radial increment, higher daily growth rates, and longer duration of xylem productivity than that at the tropical karst forest site. Weekly stem radial growth rates increased with precipitation and air temperature at the wetter ravine rainforest site, while relative humidity had a positive effect at the drier karst forest site. Our findings indicate that drought stress advances and shortens the growing season for T. ciliata. Our study highlights the strong influence of soil water capacity mediating the impact of climate, so response to drought is site-specific, which should be considered in growth models.},

Here, we assembled a dataset of tree-ring chronologies co-located within the footprint of eddy covariance towers across North America and Europe, with the aim of quantifying the sensitivity of tree radial growth versus gross primary productivity (GPP) during and following drought. We found that drought induced a large decoupling across C cycle processes, whereby GPP was relatively resistant to water stress despite large reductions in tree-ring widths. This decoupling also occurred in the year following drought (i.e., a `drought legacy effect'), and was similar in magnitude in response to both summer and winter droughts. By modeling whole-forest C turnover time, we show that a radial growth-GPP decoupling has important ramifications for the forest C cycle, especially if the C not used to support radial growth is instead allocated towards pools with short residence times. Our results demonstrate that quantifications of drought impacts that rely solely on C uptake are missing this fundamental pathway through which drought alters the forest C cycle and the resulting feedbacks to the climate system.},

We used detailed observations of wood formation (xylogenesis) and intra-annual tree-ring properties (quantitative wood anatomy and stable carbon isotopes) combined with physiological water-stress monitoring. During 41 days of tree water deficit, we observed an increase in 13C but a reduction in cell enlargement and wall thickening processes, which impacted the anatomical characteristics. These adjustments diminished carbon sequestration by 67\% despite an 11\% increase in water-use efficiency during drought. However, with the resumption of a positive hydric state in the stem, we observed a fast recovery of cell formation rates based on the accumulated assimilates produced during drought. Our findings enhance our understanding of carbon and water fluxes between the atmosphere and forest ecosystems, providing observational evidence on the tree intra-annual carbon sequestration and water-use efficiency dynamics to improve future generations of vegetation models.},

  abstract = {Tree-ring anatomy, microdensity and isotope records provide valuable intra-annual information. However, extracting signals at that scale is challenged by the complexity of xylogenesis, where two major processes \textendash{} cell enlargement and wall thickening \textendash{} occur at different times and rates. We characterized the space-for-time association in the tree rings of three conifer species by examining the duration, overlapping, inter-tree synchronicity and interannual stability during cell enlargement and wall thickening across regular tree-ring sectors (portions of equal tangential width). The number of cells and cell differentiation rates determined the duration of sector formation, which augmented more rapidly throughout the ring for wall thickening than for enlargement. Increasing the number of sectors above c. 15 had a limited effect on improving time resolution because consecutive sector formation overlapped greatly in time, especially in narrow rings and during wall thickening. Increasing the number of sectors also resulted in lower synchronicity and stability of intermediate-sector enlargement, whereas all sectors showed high synchronicity and stability during wall thickening. Increasing the number of sectors had a stronger effect on enhancing time-series resolution for enlargement- than for wall-thickening-related traits, which would nevertheless produce more reliable intra-annual chronologies as a result of the more similar calendars across trees and years in wall thickening.},

  abstract = {Realistic forecasting of forest responses to climate change critically depends on key advancements in global vegetation modelling. Compared with traditional `big-leaf' models that simulate forest stands, `next-generation' vegetation models aim to track carbon-, light-, water-, and nutrient-limited growth of individual trees. Wood biology can play an important role in delivering the required knowledge at tissue-to-individual levels, at minute-to-century scales and for model parameterization and benchmarking. We propose a wood biology research agenda that contributes to filling six knowledge gaps: sink versus source limitation, drivers of intra-annual growth, drought impacts, functional wood traits, dynamic biomass allocation, and nutrient cycling. Executing this agenda will expedite model development and increase the ability of models to forecast global change impact on forest dynamics.},

  abstract = {The timing of diel stem growth of mature forest trees is still largely unknown, as empirical data with high temporal resolution have not been available so far. Consequently, the effects of day\textendash night conditions on tree growth remained uncertain. Here we present the first comprehensive field study of hourly-resolved radial stem growth of seven temperate tree species, based on 57 million underlying data points over a period of up to 8 yr. We show that trees grow mainly at night, with a peak after midnight, when the vapour pressure deficit (VPD) is among the lowest. A high VPD strictly limits radial stem growth and allows little growth during daylight hours, except in the early morning. Surprisingly, trees also grow in moderately dry soil when the VPD is low. Species-specific differences in diel growth dynamics show that species able to grow earlier during the night are associated with the highest number of hours with growth per year and the largest annual growth increment. We conclude that species with the ability to overcome daily water deficits faster have greater growth potential. Furthermore, we conclude that growth is more sensitive than carbon uptake to dry air, as growth stops before stomata are known to close.},
