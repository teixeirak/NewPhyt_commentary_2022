  abstract = {Carbon (C) fixation, allocation, and metabolism by trees set the basis for energy and material flows in forest ecosystems and define their interactions with Earth's changing climate. However, while many studies have considered variation in productivity with latitude and climate, we lack a cohesive synthesis on how forest carbon fluxes vary globally with respect to climate and one another. Here, we draw upon 1,319 records from the Global Forest Carbon Database, representing all major forest types and the nine most significant autotrophic carbon fluxes, to comprehensively review how annual C cycling in mature, undisturbed forests varies with latitude and climate on a global scale. Across all flux variables analyzed, rates of C cycling decreased continuously with absolute latitude\textemdash a finding that confirms multiple previous studies and contradicts the idea that net primary productivity of temperate forests rivals that of tropical forests. C flux variables generally displayed similar trends across latitude and multiple climate variables, with no differences in allocation detected at this global scale. Temperature variables in general, and mean annual temperature or temperature seasonality in particular, were the best single predictors of C flux, explaining 19\%\textendash 71\% of variation in the C fluxes analyzed. The effects of temperature were modified by moisture availability, with C flux reduced under hot and dry conditions and sometimes under very high precipitation. Annual C fluxes increased with growing season length and were also influenced by growing season climate. These findings clarify how forest C flux varies with latitude and climate on a global scale. In an era when forests will play a critical yet uncertain role in shaping Earth's rapidly changing climate, our synthesis provides a foundation for understanding global patterns in forest C cycling.},

However, less is known about how spring temperatures affect tree stem growth, which sequesters carbon (C) in wood that has a long residence time in the ecosystem15,16. Using dendrometer band measurements from 463 trees across two forests, we show that warmer spring temperatures shifted the woody growth of deciduous trees earlier but had no consistent effect on peak growing season length, maximum daily growth rates, or annual growth. The latter finding was confirmed on the centennial scale by 207 tree-ring chronologies from 108 forests across eastern North America, where annual growth was far more sensitive to temperatures during the peak growing season than in the spring. These findings imply that extra CO2 uptake in years with warmer springs10\textendash 12 is not allocated to long-lived woody biomass, where it could have a substantial and lasting impact on the forest C balance.  Rather, contradicting current projections from global C cycle models2,3,17,18, our empirical results imply that warming spring temperatures are unlikely to increase the woody productivity or strengthen the CO2 sink of temperate deciduous forests.},

  abstract = {Climate extremes will increasingly influence ecosystem productivity of tropical forests, but little is known about their effects on tree stem radial growth, a major component of forest productivity. To analyze the role of climatic drivers and local site differences on tree growth at sub-annual timescales, we studied the timing, magnitude and climatic drivers of stem growth and xylem formation at two tropical forest sites with contrasting soil water availability in southwestern China. We combined high-resolution point dendrometer recordings and microcoring to investigate intra-annual stem radius variation and xylem formation of Toona ciliata over three consecutive years (2018\textendash 2020). Stem radial increment of T. ciliata derived from dendrometer data showed distinct seasonal patterns, with growth mainly occurring during March to October. The start day of stem radial growth coincided with the occurrence of the cell enlarging phase, and its end day occurred concomitantly with the cessation of cell enlarging as identified from microcores. Toona ciliata trees at the tropical ravine rainforest site with higher soil water availability showed higher mean annual stem radial increment, higher daily growth rates, and longer duration of xylem productivity than that at the tropical karst forest site. Weekly stem radial growth rates increased with precipitation and air temperature at the wetter ravine rainforest site, while relative humidity had a positive effect at the drier karst forest site. Our findings indicate that drought stress advances and shortens the growing season for T. ciliata. Our study highlights the strong influence of soil water capacity mediating the impact of climate, so response to drought is site-specific, which should be considered in growth models.},

  abstract = {The ability of forests to withstand, and recover from, acute drought stress is a critical uncertainty regarding the impacts of climate change on the terrestrial carbon (C) cycle, but it is unclear how drought responses scale from individual trees to whole forests. Here, we assembled a dataset of tree-ring chronologies co-located within the footprint of eddy covariance towers across North America and Europe, with the aim of quantifying the sensitivity of tree radial growth versus gross primary productivity (GPP) during and following drought. We found that drought induced a large decoupling across C cycle processes, whereby GPP was relatively resistant to water stress despite large reductions in tree-ring widths. This decoupling also occurred in the year following drought (i.e., a `drought legacy effect'), and was similar in magnitude in response to both summer and winter droughts. By modeling whole-forest C turnover time, we show that a radial growth-GPP decoupling has important ramifications for the forest C cycle, especially if the C not used to support radial growth is instead allocated towards pools with short residence times. Our results demonstrate that quantifications of drought impacts that rely solely on C uptake are missing this fundamental pathway through which drought alters the forest C cycle and the resulting feedbacks to the climate system.},
